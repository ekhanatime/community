- Sewage System (edge-based)

### Amenities
- Parking Garage
- Common Areas
- Laundry Facilities

## Resource Management

The game tracks various resources:
- Population capacity
- Power usage (kWh)
- Water consumption (m³)
- Sewage capacity
- Parking spaces
- Building costs (NOK)

## Development

Built using:
- HTML5 Canvas
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Bootstrap 5
- FontAwesome icons
- Custom CSS animations

## Getting Started

# 🌍 Welcome to Ekhana

A global movement for shared communities, digital connection, and sustainable living.
Ekhana is more than a project—it's a vision for a world where people come together to create, share, and build both physical and digital communities. We believe in collaboration over competition, sustainability over waste, and unity over isolation.

## What is Ekhana?

Ekhana empowers individuals to co-create modular villages, share resources, and build meaningful connections—both in the real world and in virtual spaces.

Imagine a community where:

- Instead of everyone owning their own tools, we share what we already have.
- Instead of being tied to one place, we connect across borders—through digital spaces and immersive VR environments.
- Instead of living in isolation, we foster relationships, trade skills, and grow together.

## 🌱 Our Vision

Ekhana is about rethinking how we live, work, and interact. Our goal is to create a network of sustainable, modular villages that embrace:

✅ **Cooperation** – A world where people trade skills, goods, and services instead of hoarding resources.  
✅ **Sustainability** – Communities built with minimal environmental impact and maximum inclusivity.  
✅ **Digital Connection** – Virtual spaces where we can visit, collaborate, and share experiences—without physical limitations.

## 🏡 How It Works

🔹 **Physical Communities** – Sustainable, modular villages built on shared resources and cooperation.  
🔹 **Virtual Tribe** – A digital space where anyone can join, build, and interact in 3D environments.  
🔹 **Decentralized Sharing** – Tools, knowledge, and skills freely exchanged to reduce waste and encourage self-sufficiency.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository contains multiple components of the Ekhana ecosystem:

- **area_planner/** - A web-based application for planning sustainable village layouts
  - Built with Flask (backend) and Vue.js (frontend)
  - Features 3D visualization of building layouts
  - Includes sustainability metrics and resource planning

- **website/** - The main Ekhana website
- **website_v2/** - Updated version of the Ekhana website
- **game_server/** - Game server implementation for virtual interactions

## 🤝 Join Us

Ekhana is open to anyone who believes in building a better world. Whether you're a creator, developer, entrepreneur, or just someone looking for a deeper sense of community, there's a place for you here.
